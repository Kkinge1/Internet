         <p style="background-color: mediumvioletred; font-family:Arial; margin:0px 500px 25px 0px">HTTP is a protocol used for transmitting data over the web. It defines how messages are formatted and transmitted and how web servers and browsers should respond to various commands. When you type a URL into your browser, your browser sends an HTTP request to a web server. The server processes the request and sends back the requested item, such as web pages, images, videos, etc.

        <p style="background-color: mediumvioletred; font-family:Arial; margin:0px 500px 25px 0px">DNS is like the Internet's phonebook, translating human-readable domain names (like example.com) into IP addresses (like 192.0.2.1) that computers use to locate servers. When you enter a domain name in your browser, your device sends a request to a DNS server. The DNS server changes the domain name to its corresponding IP address. The device then uses the IP address to connect to the appropriate server to retrieve the web content.
