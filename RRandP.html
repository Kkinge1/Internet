        <br>
    <p style="background-color: mediumvioletred; font-family:Arial; margin:0px 500px 25px 0px">Routers are devices that direct data traffic between different computer networks. When data is sent across the Internet, it travels in packets. Routers examine these packets and determine the best path to send them toward their destination using protocols to make routing decisions. Routers link local networks (e.g., your home network) to larger networks (e.g., your ISP's network), allowing for afficient data flow
    <p style="background-color: mediumvioletred; font-family:Arial; margin:0px 500px 25px 0px"> Redundancy is the inclusion of extra pathways or components to ensure reliability and availability. If one route or device fails, redundancy ensures that data can still be transmitted via alternative routes or backups. For example, the Internet uses a mesh-like structure where multiple paths connect each device or network, so there’s no single point of failure. This improves fault tolerance and ensures the system keeps working even if some parts fail. It also increases reliability, minimizing downtime and service interruptions.
        </p>
        <p style="background-color: mediumvioletred; font-family:Arial; margin:0px 500px 25px 0px"> Packets are small units of data that are transmitted across a network. When you send or request data (e.g., loading a web page), the data is broken into smaller chunks called packets. Each packet contains a header (metadata like source, destination, and sequence number) and the actual data being transmitted. Packets are sent independently and can take different routes to their destination. Once they arrive, they’re reassembled into the original data. This allows for efficient transmission because smaller chunks are easier to manage and can share network bandwidth with other data. It also allows for only a lost or currupted packet needs to be resent, not the entire data set.
        </p>
        <p style="background-color: mediumvioletred; font-family:Arial; margin:0px 500px 25px 0px"> When you use the internet, your data is split into packets. Routers decide how to send each packet toward its destination. The Internet’s redundancy ensures that if one route fails, others are used, ensuring the packets still reach their target. This design makes the Internet highly reliable, efficient, and scalable.
