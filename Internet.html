Key Features of the Internet include a decentralized network, global reach, a packet network, and protocols. It works by connecting devices to local networks (like Wi-Fi or cellular networks), which are linked to larger networks (like an Internet Service Provider, or ISP), routing data towards its destination using the most efficient path, the Domain Name System, and content delivery. The internet is used for communication, info sharing, commerce, entertainment, work and collaboration, and connecting everyday devices to automate and enhace functionality.
